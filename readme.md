# Universal Links Demo

Demo for how to link Mobile apps with Web servers using Universal Links between browser and app.

This project contains the various parts necessary for testing Universal Links (web-links that open in a browser if associated app is not installed, and in the app if it is installed).

It currently consists of the following parts:

- [server/](Server): A web-server hosting the URLs and some pages linking to them.
- [SwiftUIDemo/](SwiftUIDemo): An iOS demo app implemented entirely in SwiftUI.
- [UIKitDemo/](UIKitDemo): An iOS demo app implemented with UIKit.

## TODO

For additional showcasing, the following parts will be added as time permits:

- Mac apps (AppKit, UIKit, SwiftUI)
- Android (Java/Kotlin)
- Xamarin app with iOS/Android/Mac versions
